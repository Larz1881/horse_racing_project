Below is a first-pass sort of every term you supplied.
Many comments can live in more than one bucket (e.g., **‚ÄúDrifted‚Äù** can be both path and behavioural), but I placed each where it will be most useful for day-to-day trip-note coding.
Anything that didn‚Äôt fit cleanly is parked in **‚ßâ *outliers*** for follow-up.
